# STM32_HAL_PCA9685_driver


Connecting: GND (GND)
            SCL (SCL on STM32)
            SDA (SDA on STM32)
            0E (open)
            VCC (3.3V)
            V+ (open)
            
            
Device address is 0x80 (in arduino it is 0x40, maybe Arduino automatically right shift 1 bit for 7 bits I2C address).
